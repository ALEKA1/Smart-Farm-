############ Farm2.0 ######### 


Authors: Salim Khazem, 

Farm2.0 is a smart project that allows to interact and improve the management of agricultural farms, this project will also allow intelligent management of hydraulic resources automatic irrigation systems, and according to the need of plants, it will also allow to control the humidity and the ambient temperature in the greenhouse, which will allow to have a global vision on what will happen in the greenhouse equipped with sensors and actuator, this will enable the intelligent management of the farm.





With regard to the material:
- Arduino
- Analog sensors
- Relays
- engines
- Solenoid valves
- Graphic interfaces (LCD ...)


Before running the program you must add the libraries to the Arduino libraries folder.

To do this: copy the two folders (Adafruit_Sensor and DHT) that are in the libraries folder (the one I put), paste them in the arduino libraries folder.

for me it's: C: \ Program Files \ Arduino \ libraries
